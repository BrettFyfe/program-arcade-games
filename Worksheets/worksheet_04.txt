     Reminder: Please use full sentences, capital letters, and proper grammar
     where appropriate.
     Don't create a loop that only loops once. That doesn't make sense.
     Python runs the code once by default anyway. Avoid loops like this:
     
    
for i in range(1):
# Do something.
1. Write a Python program that will use a for loop to print your name 10 times, and then the word ``Done'' at the end.
for a in range(10):
print(‘Brett’)

	print(‘done’)
     
2. Write a Python program that will use a for loop to print ``Red'' and then ``Gold'' 20 times. (Red Gold Red Gold Red Gold... all on separate lines. Don't use \n.)
for a in range(20):
   print('''Red
Gold''')

print('done')
3. Write a Python program that will use a for loop to print the even numbers from 2 to 100, inclusive.
for a in range(2, 100, 2):
    print(a)
    
4. Write a Python program that will use a while loop to count from 10 down to, and including, 0. Then print the words ``Blast off!'' Remember, use a WHILE loop, don't use a FOR loop.
a = 10
while a >= 0:
    print(a)
    a = a - 1
  
print('Blast off!')

5. There are three things wrong with this program. List each. (3 pts)

print("This program takes three numbers and returns the sum.")
total = 0
for i in range(3):
x = input("Enter a number: ")
total = total + i
print("The total is:", x)
6.  The input is not the first line of the program, the variable ‘i’ is not defined ever, and x is never turned into an integer for the print statement.

7. Write a program that prints a random integer from 1 to 10 (inclusive).
import random
x = random.randrange(1,10)
print(x)

8. Write a program that prints a random floating point number somewhere between 1 and 10 (inclusive). Do not make the mistake of generating a random number from 0 to 10 instead of 1 to 10.
import random
x = random.random() * 10
print(x)

9. Write a Python program that will: (3 pts)
Ask the user for seven numbers
Print the total sum of the numbers
Print the count of the positive entries, the number entries equal to zero, and the number of negative entries. Use an if, elif, else chain, not just three if statements.
positive = 0
negative = 0 
zero = 0
numberlist = []
number1 = int(input('Number: '))
number2 = int(input('Number: '))
number3 = int(input('Number: '))
number4 = int(input('Number: '))
number5 = int(input('Number: '))
number6 = int(input('Number: '))
number7 = int(input('Number: '))

total = number1 + number2 + number3 + number4 + number5 + number6 + number7
print("The sum is: " + str(total))

numberlist.append(number1)
numberlist.append(number2)
numberlist.append(number3)
numberlist.append(number4)
numberlist.append(number5)
numberlist.append(number6)
numberlist.append(number7)

for i in numberlist:
    if int(i) > 0:
        positive = positive + 1
    elif int(i) < 0:
        negative = negative + 1
    else:
        zero = zero + 1

print("Zero: " + str(zero))
print("Positive: " + str(positive))
print("Negative: " + str(negative))

10. Coin flip tosser: (4 pts)
Create a program that will print a random 0 or 1.
Instead of 0 or 1, print heads or tails. Do this using if statements. Don't select from a list, as shown in the chapter.
Add a loop so that the program does this 50 times.
Create a running total for the number of heads flipped, and the number of tails.
import random
heads = 0
tails = 0
   
for a in range(50):
    x = random.randrange(0,2)
    if x == 1:
        print('Tails')
        tails = tails + 1
    if x == 0:
        print('Heads')
        heads = heads + 1
        
print(heads)
print(tails)

11. Write a program that plays rock, paper, scissors: (4 pts)
Create a program that randomly prints 0, 1, or 2.
Expand the program so it randomly prints rock, paper, or scissors using if statements. Don't select from a list, as shown in the chapter.
Add to the program so it first asks the user their choice.
(It will be easier if you have them enter 1, 2, or 3.)
Add conditional statement to figure out who wins

import random
x = random.randrange(1, 4)
# x1 = rock x2 = paper x3 = scissors
userinp = int(input('Rock Paper or scissors? 1, 2 ,3: '))

if x == 1 and userinp == 1:
    print('Two Rocks. Tie.')
elif x == 1 and userinp == 2:
    print('Paper beats Rock, you win!')
elif x == 1 and userinp == 3:
    print('Rock beats scissors, you lose!')
elif x == 2 and userinp == 1:
    print('Paper beats rock, you lose!')
elif x == 2 and userinp == 2:
    print('Two paper. Tie.')
elif x == 2 and userinp == 3:
    print('Scissors beats paper, you win!')
elif x == 3 and userinp == 1:
    print('Rock beats paper, you win!')
elif x == 3 and userinp == 2:
    print('Scissors beats paper, you lose!')
else:
    print('Two scissors, tie.')
