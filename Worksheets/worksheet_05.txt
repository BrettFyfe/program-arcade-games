     Reminder: Please use full sentences, capital letters, and proper grammar
     where appropriate.
     
  1. 1. Explain how the computer coordinate system differs from the standard Cartesian coordinate system. There are two main differences. List both.
  
The y co-ordinates works backwards 

2. Before a Python Pygame program can use any functions like pygame.display.set_mode(), what two lines of code must occur first?

Set color variables and set the size of the text window

3. Explain how WHITE = (255, 255, 255) represents a color.

Its the a combination of red green and white on the color spectrum.

4. When do we use variable names for colors in all upper-case, and when do we use variable names for colors in all lower-case? (This applies to all variables, not just colors.)

	fixed variables are in all caps always and lower case could change
     
5. What does the pygame.display.set_mode() function do?

Tells the program how big the window is going to be 

6. What does this for event in pygame.event.get() loop do?

Helps manage the pygame event queue

7. What is pygame.time.Clock used for?

Tells the program how many times to update the screen per second

8. For this line of code: (3 pts)
pygame.draw.line(screen, GREEN, [0, 0], [100, 100], 5)

What does screen do?

Tells the program where to draw the shape

What does [0, 0] do?

Tells the starting point

What does [100, 100] do?

Tells the ending point

What does 5 do?

Tells the program the width in pixels

9. What is the best way to repeat something over and over in a drawing?

a for loop

10. When drawing a rectangle, what happens if the specified line width is zero?

It wont draw the rectangle

11. Describe the ellipse drawn in the code below.
What is the x, y of the origin coordinate? 20, 20
What does the origin coordinate specify? The center of the circle? The center of the circle
What is the length and the width of the ellipse? 100 , 250
pygame.draw.ellipse(screen, BLACK, [20, 20, 250, 100], 2)

12. When drawing an arc, what additional information is needed over drawing an ellipse?

The pi values to show what section of the circle to draw

13. Describe, in general, what are the three steps needed when printing text to the screen using graphics?

Tell the program the text content, the font of text you want to use and the text color.

14. When drawing text, the first line of the three lines needed to draw text should actually be outside the main program loop.
It should only run once at the start of the program. Why is this? You may need to ask.

So you can set the text to what you want to print

15. What are the coordinates of the polygon that the code below draws?
pygame.draw.polygon(screen, BLACK, [[50,100],[0,200],[200,200],[100,50]], 5)
[50,100], [0,200], [200,200], [100,50]

16. What does pygame.display.flip() do?

Updates the screen with everything you've drawn

17. What does pygame.quit() do?

Exits the drawing window

18. Look up on-line how the pygame.draw.circle works. Get it working and paste a working sample here. I only need the one line of code that draws the circle, but make sure it is working by trying it out in a full working program.
	pygame.draw.circle(50, 50)
