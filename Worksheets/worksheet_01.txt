     When writing answers to questions, please use proper grammar, capitalization,
     and punctuation. Please limit the length of each line to 80 characters.
     
  1. Write a line of code that will print your name.
  
  print('Brett')

  2. How do you enter a comment in a program?

by using a hash(#)

  3. What do the following lines of code output?
     	ALSO: Why do they give a different answer?
     
     print(2 / 3)
     print(2 // 3)
     
     line 1- 0.66
     line 2- 0
     they print differently due to the extra division mark given
     
  4. Write a line of code that creates a variable called pi and sets
     	it to an appropriate value.
          
          pi = 3.14

  5. Why does this code not work?
     
     A = 22
     print(a)
     
     because you didnt capitalize the variable in the print statement
  6. All of the variable names below can be used. But which ONE of these is
     	the better variable name to use?
     
     a
     A
     Area
     AREA
     area
     area_of_rectangle
     Area_Of_Rectangle
     
     the most specific one as to what you intend to set the variable value to.
     
  7. Which of these variables names are not allowed in Python? (More than one
     might be wrong. Also, this question is not asking about improper names, just
     names that aren't allowed. Test them if you aren't sure.)
     
     apple
     Apple
     APPLE
     Apple2
     1Apple
     account number
     account_number
     account.number
     accountNumber
     account#
     pi
     PI
     fred
     Fred
     GreatBigVariable
     greatBigVariable
     great_big_variable
     great.big.variable
     2x
     x2x
     total%
     #left
     
     dont work: 2x, great.big.variable, account.number, account#, total%, 
  8. Why does this code not work?
     
     print(a)
     a = 45
     
     you assigned the variable after the print statement
     
  9. Explain the mistake in this code:
     
     pi = float(3.14)
     
     the number you wanted to assign to a float is already a float
     
 10. This program runs, but the code still could be better. Explain what is
     wrong with the code.
     
     radius = float(input("Radius:"))
     x = 3.14
     pi = x
     area = pi  * radius ** 2
     print(area)
     
     you could just set pi straight to 3.14 instead of using a pointless 'x' variable.
     
 11. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = ((x) * (y))
     print(a)
     
     unnessecary variable 'a', when you can just print the value in the print statement and save some space
     
 12. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     x = 4
     y = 5
     a = 3(x + y)
     print(a)
     
     there is none
 13. Explain the mistake in the following code:
     
     radius = input(float("Enter the radius:"))
     
     you set the input before the float, it needs to be reversed
 14. Do all these print the same value? Which one is better to use and why?
     
     print(2/3+4)
     print(2 / 3 + 4)
     print(   2 /    3+    4  )
     
     yes, the second one cuz its easiest to read.
     
 15. What is a constant?

a varaible that is set and never changed
 16. How are variable names for constants different than other variable names?

they are always in all caps

 17. What is a single quote and what is a double quote?
     Give and label an example of both.
     ', "
     'hi' < single
     "hi" < double
     
 18. Write a Python program that will use escape codes to print a double-quote
     and a new line using the Window's standard. (Note: I'm asking for the Window's
     standard here. Look it up out of Chapter 1.)

"i want to print double quotes\" for some reason"
 19. Can a Python program print text to the screen using single quotes instead
     of double quotes?
     yes

 20. Why does this code not calculate the average?
     
     print(3 + 4 + 5 / 3)
     
 the order of operations is used incorrectly
 
 21. What is an ``operator'' in Python?

special symbols that carry logical or mathmatic operation

 22. What does the following program print out?
     
     x = 3
     x + 1
     print(x)
     
     3
 23. Correct the following code:
     
     user_name = input("Enter your name: )"
     
     user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
 24. Correct the following code:
     
     value = int(input(print("Enter your age")))
     
     value = int(input("Enter your age: ")
     print(value)
